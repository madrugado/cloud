# ai-gateway

Next.js app that serves the AI gateway API on its own. It deploys to the
`kilocode-ai-gateway` Vercel project, whose functions run in `fra1` and `sfo1`
(`vercel.json`). `apps/web` still serves the same handlers under its own paths.

- Every route lives under `/api/v1`. There are no `/api/gateway` or `/api/openrouter`
  aliases. Each `apps/web` route maps to the path without that prefix, and the
  `v1` variants in `apps/web` collapse into the same route: `/api/gateway/v1/models`
  and `/api/openrouter/models` both become `/api/v1/models`. `/api/fim`,
  `/api/edit`, `/api/organizations` and the typesafe `/api/gateway/typesafe/v1/systemone`
  move under `/api/v1` too; the latter becomes `/api/v1/systemone`.
- Route files are thin facades over handlers in `packages/web-shared`. Keep the
  `apps/web` `maxDuration` and `withRestTiming` usage, with route patterns that
  match this app's paths. Import them as `@kilocode/web-shared/…`; see
  `packages/web-shared/AGENTS.md`.
- Handlers that depend on the path accept both apps' paths, such as the LLM
  proxy's path validation.
- `pnpm dev` runs with the web app's environment files. `pnpm dev:start` starts
  it automatically as a dependency of the web app, on port 3010 plus the worktree
  port offset. The web app rewrites gateway requests to it in development and to
  `https://ai-gateway.kilo.ai` in production, on both global and non-global backends.
- Deploys are manual for now: run the `Deploy AI Gateway` workflow
  (`deploy-ai-gateway.yml`) from `main`. It deploys the commit of the last
  completed scheduled release for the chosen environment, so the database is
  already migrated, and the scheduled web deploys do not touch this app. Crons
  stay on the web app; do not add them to this app's `vercel.json`.
- Server-side Sentry and OpenTelemetry come from
  `packages/web-shared/src/lib/observability`, registered in
  `src/instrumentation.ts` with the `kilocode-ai-gateway` service name. The app
  has no client or Edge runtime code, so it has no client or Edge Sentry config.
