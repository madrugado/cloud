/**
 * Maps the structured failure cloud-agent-next already sends on the code review

 *
 * cloud-agent-next classifies every terminal failure into a
 * `CloudAgentSafeFailure` ({ stage, code, subtype, attempts, message }) and puts
 * it on the callback payload. Historically the receiver read `failure.code` for
 * exactly one case (workspace_setup_failed + sandbox_storage_full) and ignored
 * the rest, so ~26% of failures were stored with a NULL terminal_reason and a
 * human-readable sentence in error_message. The admin error analysis then tried
 * to recover the category by pattern-matching that sentence, and everything it
 * missed collapsed into "Other".
 *
 * This module consumes the structured value instead, so classification no longer
 * round-trips through English.
